        I am an aspiring self-taught Full Stack Web Developer. My interests are in Javascript and Python. For the past few months, I have been learning about Front End development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am also interested in building chatbots and Machine Learning. As a result, I have been learning Python. You can find more information about me in my <a href="./resources/documents/Black & White Minimalistic Professional Resume.pdf">resume</a>.
        <br><br>
        I am partially sighted due to a condition called Keratoconus. This has led to me becoming a disability activist. I would like to build accessible websites so that all people are able to use them despite their physical or mental condition.
        <br><br>  
        When I am not coding I like taking nature walks, looking for the cosiest coffee shops in town or spending time with my friends and family. I am also an avid knitter!
