### Khayelitsha

The idea of creating a website for Khayelitsha came when I was trying to look for an educational psychologist for my nephew. I went online and tried looking but couldn't find resources or they were all over the place. I thought it would make it easier for people in Khayelitsha to have one place where they can visit to look for resources. This will make sure they save data because they will not be looking at different websites.

The features of this website is that it will be responsive. Most people in Khayelitsha do not have laptops but they have smart phones. You will also be able to click on a phone number and it goes to your contacts application on your phone.

The website has been built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The data is stored with SQL.

#### Universities

This is a website that provides a generic application for all universities. A student will fill in details such as their name, ID number, physical and email address, matric marks, etc and these details will be saved. Then they will be provided a link to the application pages of different universities and the details will be automatically filled. The student will then fill in whatever information is specific to that university.
